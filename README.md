# TMS location

Code to visualize and locate points for trans-cranial magnetic stimulation
(TMS).


## Requirements

- You need mesh data generated by https://github.com/bast/MRI-extract-surfaces.
- You need an installation of [Apptainer](https://apptainer.org/) (e.g. following
  the [quick
  installation](https://apptainer.org/docs/user/latest/quick_start.html#quick-installation)).
  Alternatively, [SingularityCE](https://sylabs.io/singularity/) should also
  work.


## How to use it

First download the container image (ending with *.sif) from here:
https://github.com/bast/tms-location/releases

Then point the container image to the directory where you have the mesh data:
```bash
$ ./tms-location.sif /path/to/ernie_data
```

Then open the browser at the URL shown in the terminal (typically <http://127.0.0.1:8050>).


## The code uses the [potpourri3d library](https://github.com/nmwsharp/potpourri3d) to compute geodesic paths

## About the container image

To build the image, I have used [this wonderful
guide](https://github.com/singularityhub/singularity-deploy) as starting point
and inspiration.

I find it important that everybody can verify how the container image was
built. And you can! You can inspect the definition file and all scripts which
are all part of this repository.
